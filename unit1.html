<p> This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers. Learn how complex information like numbers, text, images, and sound are represented in text, how compression works, and the broader social impacts of digitizing the world's information.Digital information is all around us, and it's changing the way we live, work, and communicate. In today's digital age, we use devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets to store and access information. This information can take many forms, including text, images, videos, and audio files. When we send or share digital information, it's sent through the internet as a series of electronic signals. These signals are then decoded and reconstructed by our devices, allowing us to view or listen to the information. Digital information is incredibly valuable because it allows us to access vast amounts of knowledge and communicate with others instantly. With digital information, we can learn new things, stay connected with friends and family, and even conduct business transactions online.</p>
